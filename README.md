# _`MY DEVELOPER JOURNEY`_

Hello everyone, i am **_Johnzel Marahay_**, _18_, _Male_ and currently _studying at OLLC_\
\
This README file will contain the record/documentation of my progress in programming, its to showcase what i improved on
over the years and what i also leanred throughout that period.\
Please be noted that as the repository is named; so does the record does, meaning that this only contains 1 month of my
progress in programming/coding.\


The upcoming projects that will be created for the whole month will be:\
`Calculator` _preferably with_ `UI`.\
`Role Management System` within work, ideally with UI but will prefer with CLI/Terminal Only.



Should i not meet this projects within the alotted time, i will continue to finish this through the next month within `10days only!`.\
That being said, the first project will be made is the `Calculator`.




Before i start, i would like to put the structure of how will i create the calculator:\
`Idea` = Create a calculator with UI and History Tracking.\
`Application` = Understand how logic works and data management in order to make said project.\
`Optionals` = Create UI within that said calculator, but cannot use extensive programming language.\
`Language` = Python only.
